can we make the change where instead of being in the weapon Configs, the following are part of it's weapon's db?

name
type
image
maxLevel
apMax

and assume minLevel is 1, unless added manually into the config.
make the required changes to the weapons db, use image names if in the images folder, and they match said weapon, otherwise leave it as ''
move any matching info from the configs to the db and if there's no info already, use context cluse to fill in the rest of the db files.
- like, assuming apmax for all weapons is 100, unless it's a secondary weapon like a pistol (ggh for ex)
- assume all max level is 40, unless manually changed.
